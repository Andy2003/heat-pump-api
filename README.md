HeatPump API
===

This project aims to provide a uniform abstraction layer for heat pumps.

API-Definition
---

In the file heatpump_api.yaml is an AsyncAPI description, which can be edited by [AsyncAPI Editor](http://editor.asyncapi.org/).
It defines the endpoints to communicate with the heat pump.

Implementation
---

The script heat-pump.py is the 1st draft to implement the API for accessing my heat pump `WPL-10 AC` manufactured by Stiebel Eltron.
The measured values are published by the script via mqtt.

The protocol was taken from [juerg5524.ch](http://juerg5524.ch/list_data.php). The [ElsterTable](doc/ElsterTable.inc) 
is the base for [the mapping file](stiebel-eltron.csv) of this project.
